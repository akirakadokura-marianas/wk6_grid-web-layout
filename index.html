            <h2>Interesting Facts About Me</h2>
            <p>I play for the National Team for Soccer for the NMI. I have traveled to many places including the Middle East,
            South Asia, and the Melanesia. I am a full blood Japanese, born and raised in the islands. 
            I grew up very close to the beach, since both my parents were scuba diving instructors.

            <p>I think I will call it the store for my pseudo business called "Whitecaps". I hope to make a store website
                where customers will be able to purchase items from the store.
